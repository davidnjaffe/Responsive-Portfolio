# responsive-portfolio

For this assignment I built a responsive portfolio site using the Bootstrap framework. This is using the grid style layout utilizing class “row” and class”col” defining the appropriate grid spacing. Using this framework it creates a responsive layout without using the @media query. 
This site has a short “about me”, “portfolio section and a contact form that is yet to be functional.
